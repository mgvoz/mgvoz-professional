                After 7 years as a technology-forward educator, I wanted to learn more about the software that I had been using in my classroom; this is where my journey to becoming a self-taught programmer began. Now, I am a UI/UX Software Developer that is equipped with all of the soft skills that are sharpened by a teaching career, and has the capacity to never stop learning. I am seeking new opportunities that will allow me to explore new, modern technologies, continue to grow as a software development professional, and contribute to innovative and dynamic projects.
